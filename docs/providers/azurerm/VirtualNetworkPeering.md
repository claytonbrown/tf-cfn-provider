resources in the linked virtual network.

## Properties

`Name` - (Required) The name of the virtual network peering. Changing this
forces a new resource to be created.

`VirtualNetworkName` - (Required) The name of the virtual network. Changing
this forces a new resource to be created.

`RemoteVirtualNetworkId` - (Required) The full Azure resource ID of the
remote virtual network.  Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

`ResourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
create the virtual network. Changing this forces a new resource to be
created.

`AllowVirtualNetworkAccess` - (Optional) Controls if the VMs in the remote
virtual network can access VMs in the local virtual network. Defaults to
false.

`AllowForwardedTraffic` - (Optional) Controls if forwarded traffic from  VMs
in the remote virtual network is allowed. Defaults to false.

`AllowGatewayTransit` - (Optional) Controls gatewayLinks can be used in the
remote virtual networkâ€™s link to the local virtual network.

`UseRemoteGateways` - (Optional) Controls if remote gateways can be used on
