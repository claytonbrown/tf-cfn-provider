# Terraform::NSXT::FirewallSection

This resource provides a way to configure a firewall section on the NSX manager. A firewall section is a collection of firewall rules that are grouped together.

## Properties

`DisplayName` - (Optional) The display name of this firewall section. Defaults to ID if not set.

`Description` - (Optional) Description of this firewall section.

`Tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this firewall section.

`AppliedTo` - (Optional) List of objects where the rules in this section will be enforced. This will take precedence over rule level applied_to. [Supported target types: "LogicalPort", "LogicalSwitch", "NSGroup"].

`SectionType` - (Required) Type of the rules which a section can contain. Either LAYER2 or LAYER3. Only homogeneous sections are supported.

`Stateful` - (Required) Stateful or Stateless nature of firewall section is enforced on all rules inside the section. Layer3 sections can be stateful or stateless. Layer2 sections can only be stateless.

`Rule` - (Optional) A list of rules to be applied in this section. each rule has the following arguments: * `DisplayName` - (Optional) The display name of this rule. Defaults to ID if not set. * `Description` - (Optional) Description of this rule. * `Action` - (Required) Action enforced on the packets which matches the firewall rule. [Allowed values: "ALLOW", "DROP", "REJECT"] * `AppliedTo` - (Optional) List of objects where rule will be enforced. The section level field overrides this one. Null will be treated as any.

## Return Values

### Fn::GetAtt

`Id` - ID of the firewall section.

`Revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.

`IsDefault` - A boolean flag which reflects whether a firewall section is default section or not. Each Layer 3 and Layer 2 section will have at least and at most one default section.
