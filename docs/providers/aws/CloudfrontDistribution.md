# Terraform::AWS::CloudfrontDistribution

Creates an Amazon CloudFront web distribution.

For information about CloudFront distributions, see the
[Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide][1]. For specific information about creating
CloudFront web distributions, see the [POST Distribution][2] page in the Amazon
CloudFront API Reference.

~> **NOTE:** CloudFront distributions take about 15 minutes to a deployed state
after creation or modification. During this time, deletes to resources will be
blocked. If you need to delete a distribution that is enabled and you do not
want to wait, you need to use the `retain_on_delete` flag.
