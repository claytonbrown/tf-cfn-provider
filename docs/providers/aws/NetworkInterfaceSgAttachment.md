# Terraform::AWS::NetworkInterfaceSgAttachment

This resource attaches a security group to an Elastic Network Interface (ENI).
It can be used to attach a security group to any existing ENI, be it a
secondary ENI or one attached as the primary interface on an instance.

~> **NOTE on instances, interfaces, and security groups:** Terraform currently
provides the capability to assign security groups via the [`aws_instance`][1]
and the [`aws_network_interface`][2] resources. Using this resource in
conjunction with security groups provided in-line in those resources will cause
conflicts, and will lead to spurious diffs and undefined behavior - please use
one or the other.
