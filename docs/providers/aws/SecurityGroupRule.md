# Terraform::AWS::SecurityGroupRule

Provides a security group rule resource. Represents a single `ingress` or
`egress` group rule, which can be added to external Security Groups.

~> **NOTE on Security Groups and Security Group Rules:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone Security Group Rule resource (a single `ingress` or
`egress` rule), and a [Security Group resource](security_group.html) with `ingress` and `egress` rules
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Security Group with in-line rules
in conjunction with any Security Group Rule resources. Doing so will cause
a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE:** Setting `protocol = "all"` or `protocol = -1` with `from_port` and `to_port` will result in the EC2 API creating a security group rule with all ports open. This API behavior cannot be controlled by Terraform and may generate warnings in the future.

~> **NOTE:** Referencing Security Groups across VPC peering has certain restrictions. More information is available in the [VPC Peering User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-security-groups.html).
