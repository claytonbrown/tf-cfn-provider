# Terraform::AWS::AutoscalingAttachment

Provides an AutoScaling Attachment resource.

~> **NOTE on AutoScaling Groups and ASG Attachments:** Terraform currently provides
both a standalone ASG Attachment resource (describing an ASG attached to
an ELB), and an [AutoScaling Group resource](autoscaling_group.html) with
`load_balancers` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ASG with in-line
load balancers in conjunction with an ASG Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a
conflict and will overwrite attachments.

## Return Values
