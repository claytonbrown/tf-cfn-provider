# Terraform::Vault::GenericSecret

Writes and manages arbitrary data at a given path in Vault.

This resource is primarily intended to be used with
[Vault's "generic" secret backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/generic/index.html),
but it is also compatible with any other Vault endpoint that supports
the `vault write` command to create and the `vault delete` command to
delete.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Properties

`Path` - (Required) The full logical path at which to write the given data. To write data into the "generic" secret backend mounted in Vault by default, this should be prefixed with `secret/`. Writing to other backends with this resource is possible; consult each backend's documentation to see which endpoints support the `PUT` and `DELETE` methods.

`DataJson` - (Required) String containing a JSON-encoded object that will be written as the secret data at the given path.

`AllowRead` - (Optional, Deprecated) True/false. Set this to true if your vault authentication is able to read the data, this allows the resource to be compared and updated. Defaults to false.

`DisableRead` - (Optional) True/false. Set this to true if your vault authentication is not able to read the data. Setting this to `true` will break drift detection. Defaults to false.
