# Terraform::VSphere::HostPortGroup

The `vsphere_host_port_group` resource can be used to manage vSphere standard
port groups on an ESXi host. These port groups are connected to standard
virtual switches, which can be managed by the
[`vsphere_host_virtual_switch`][host-virtual-switch] resource.

For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see [this page][ref-vsphere-net-concepts].
