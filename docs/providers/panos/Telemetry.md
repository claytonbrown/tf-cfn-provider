to raise the bar against the latest attack techniques. Your participation
allows us to deliver new threat prevention controls across the attack

intelligence, and device health information to improve the fidelity of the
protections we deliver. This is an opt-in feature controlled with granular
policy, and we encourage you to join the community.
