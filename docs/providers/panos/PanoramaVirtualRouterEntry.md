# Terraform::Panos::PanoramaVirtualRouterEntry

This resource allows you to add/update/delete an interface in a Panorama
virtual router template.

This resource has some overlap with the `panos_panorama_virtual_router`
resource.  If you want to use this resource with the other one, then make
sure that your `panos_panorama_virtual_router` spec does not define the
`interfaces` field.
