# Terraform::Kubernetes::PersistentVolume

The resource provides a piece of networked storage in the cluster provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. Persistent Volumes have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV.
