# Terraform::TLS::PrivateKey

Generates a secure private key and encodes it as PEM. This resource is
primarily intended for easily bootstrapping throwaway development
environments.

~> **Important Security Notice** The private key generated by this resource will
be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file. **Use of this resource
for production deployments is *not* recommended**. Instead, generate
a private key file outside of Terraform and distribute it securely
to the system where Terraform will be run.

This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform
state and does not create any external managed resources.
