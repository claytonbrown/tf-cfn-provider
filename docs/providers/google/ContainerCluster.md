# Terraform::Google::ContainerCluster

Creates a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/clusters)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Properties

`Name` - (Required) The name of the cluster, unique within the project and zone.

`Zone` - (Optional) The zone that the master and the number of nodes specified in `InitialNodeCount` should be created in. Only one of `Zone` and `Region` may be set. If neither zone nor region are set, the provider zone is used.

`AdditionalZones` - (Optional) The list of additional Google Compute Engine locations in which the cluster's nodes should be located. If additional zones are configured, the number of nodes specified in `InitialNodeCount` is created in all specified zones.

`AddonsConfig` - (Optional) The configuration for addons supported by GKE. Structure is documented below.

`ClusterIpv4Cidr` - (Optional) The IP address range of the kubernetes pods in this cluster. Default is an automatically assigned CIDR.

`ClusterAutoscaling` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)) Configuration for cluster autoscaling (also called autoprovisioning), as described in [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning). Structure is documented below.

`Description` - (Optional) Description of the cluster.

`EnableBinaryAuthorization` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)) Enable Binary Authorization for this cluster. If enabled, all container images will be validated by Google Binary Authorization.

`EnableKubernetesAlpha` - (Optional) Whether to enable Kubernetes Alpha features for this cluster. Note that when this option is enabled, the cluster cannot be upgraded and will be automatically deleted after 30 days.

`EnableTpu` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)) Whether to enable Cloud TPU resources in this cluster. See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup).

`EnableLegacyAbac` - (Optional) Whether the ABAC authorizer is enabled for this cluster. When enabled, identities in the system, including service accounts, nodes, and controllers, will have statically granted permissions beyond those provided by the RBAC configuration or IAM. Defaults to `false`.

`InitialNodeCount` - (Optional) The number of nodes to create in this cluster (not including the Kubernetes master). Must be set if `NodePool` is not set.

`IpAllocationPolicy` - (Optional) Configuration for cluster IP allocation. As of now, only pre-allocated subnetworks (custom type with secondary ranges) are supported. This will activate IP aliases. See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases) Structure is documented below.

`LoggingService` - (Optional) The logging service that the cluster should write logs to. Available options include `logging.googleapis.com`, `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes` (beta), and `none`. Defaults to `logging.googleapis.com`.

`MaintenancePolicy` - (Optional) The maintenance policy to use for the cluster. Structure is documented below.

`MasterAuth` - (Optional) The authentication information for accessing the Kubernetes master. Structure is documented below.

`MasterAuthorizedNetworksConfig` - (Optional) The desired configuration options for master authorized networks. Omit the nested `CidrBlocks` attribute to disallow external access (except the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).

`MinMasterVersion` - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the current master version--use the read-only `master_version` field to obtain that. If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find the `Terraform::Google::ContainerEngineVersions` data source useful - it indicates which versions are available.  If you intend to specify versions manually, [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#specifying_cluster_version) describe the various acceptable formats for this field.

`MonitoringService` - (Optional) The monitoring service that the cluster should write metrics to. Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API. VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting Available options include `monitoring.googleapis.com`, `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes` (beta) and `none`. Defaults to `monitoring.googleapis.com`.

`Network` - (Optional) The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the shared network.

`NetworkPolicy` - (Optional) Configuration options for the [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/networkpolicies/) feature. Structure is documented below.

`NodeConfig` -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the cluster's nodes. Structure is documented below.

`NodePool` - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster. See [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) for schema. **Warning:** node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability to say "these are the _only_ node pools associated with this cluster", use the [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) resource instead of this property.

`NodeVersion` - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset or set to the same value as `MinMasterVersion` on create. Defaults to the default version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects nodes in the default node pool. To update nodes in other node pools, use the `version` attribute on the node pool.

`PodSecurityPolicyConfig` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)) Configuration for the [PodSecurityPolicy](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies) feature. Structure is documented below.

`PrivateClusterConfig` - (Optional) A set of options for creating a private cluster. Structure is documented below.
