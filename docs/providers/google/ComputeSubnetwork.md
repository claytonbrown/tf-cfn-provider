# Terraform::Google::ComputeSubnetwork

A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
other network-related resources.

Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
private IP addresses.

Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.

Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.
