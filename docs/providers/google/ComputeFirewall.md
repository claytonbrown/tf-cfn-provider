# Terraform::Google::ComputeFirewall

Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
instances.

All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.

The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
you need.
